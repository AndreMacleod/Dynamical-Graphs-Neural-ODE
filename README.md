# Dynamical Graphs Neural ODE

Data has 4 columns:

origin bid, destination bird, obesrvation weight, day


project.jl is the main script file, with helperFunctions.jl containing helper functions to make the main script a bit cleaner. Run helperFunctions.jl first

Potential TODO 

Attempt experiment using synthetic data to better test process and see if there is real potential behind the theory

Scale up framework - if works on large social networks - possible tool to predict/fight misinformation. Possibly use JuliaHub for this

Step from Neural ODE to Universal Differential Equations to capture any preexisting knowledge of the network dynamical system

Exploring data augmentation techniques to interpolate between the estimated embeddings, other embeddings, Inputting additional node and edge metadata, exploring different neural network architectures.


# NB
Code was written 6-7 mths ago, so likely is out of date, but this problem is being continued and worked on by fellow student at UC Connor Smith, no version of his code is online yet however.
